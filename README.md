## lovefund.us

Lovefund was created from scratch with Ruby on Rails by Beau Carnes.

This is an online portal for sharing prayer requests, and financial or service needs, 
for ourselves or others. It is also the place to fund these needs by donating our 
time, prayer, money, expertise... love.

This craigslist-like site allows users to make posts in 
one of four categories: request prayer, request help, offer prayer, offer help. 
After creating a post, an e-mail is sent to the creator with a link that must be 
clicked to make the post active. The link is also used to make any edits, to 
delete the post, or to mark the prayer or need as met. Users can then tell how 
the need or prayer request was met. I still need to implement facebook sharing, 
giving money, and anonymous e-mails. I am also going to do some more work to the 
visual appearance.
